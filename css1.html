It is the longest written national constitution in the world.

        It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950.[9] The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395.[10] India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.[11]
